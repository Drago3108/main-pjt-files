                        <p>There are people who want to work but face greater challenges in finding gainful employment. There are employers who want to hire, but can't find people with the skill sets they need. That's why we use our position to determine current and future skills gaps, identify people from various backgrounds who need help entering the workforce, and apply our expertise to create solutions that benefit both job seekers and employers. That's the heart of our workforce development initiatives.
We identify people who face barriers to employment, including individuals receiving public assistance, at-risk youth, veterans, military spouses, people with disabilities, long-term unemployed and more - and then prepare them for in-demand jobs in high-growth industries. Our customized programs provide skills assessments, job training, certification, mentoring and placement services, and partnering with employers, government and community-based organizations.
We feel privileged to help - and proud of the result: Candidates receive training in the skill sets that employers need most. Employers then have access to trained, motivated workers who can step in immediately and contribute to their growth and productivity. Promoting opportunity. Supporting businesses. And strengthening communities.</p>
